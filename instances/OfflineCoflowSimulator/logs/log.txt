EXECUTION OF DCOFLOW ALGORITHM (variant: 'dcoflow_min_all')
Processing time matrix D: [n_links * n_coflow]

-----------------Unscheduled coflows = [1,2,3,4]-----------------
Bottleneck is 2 with completion time 3.6909
Coflows using b: Sb = [1,2,4]

RejectCoflow: considering coflow 4 with deadline 3.1820
Calculate psi_(l,k') = p_{l,k'}*(T_k'-sum_{k in S_b} p_{l,k})
	on link 2: psi = 2.0755*(3.1820-3.6909) = -1.0561
	on link 3: psi = 0.9207*(3.1820-2.7840) = 0.3665
	on link 4: psi = 1.1547*(3.1820-2.4043) = 0.8981

Decision: reject coflow 1 among those using bottleneck 2

-----------------Unscheduled coflows = [2,3,4]-----------------
Bottleneck is 2 with completion time 2.5736
Coflows using b: Sb = [2,4]
Coflow 4 can be scheduled as the last one on link 2

-----------------Unscheduled coflows = [2,3]-----------------
Bottleneck is 1 with completion time 1.4974
Coflows using b: Sb = [2,3]
Coflow 2 can be scheduled as the last one on link 1

-----------------Unscheduled coflows = [3]-----------------
Bottleneck is 3 with completion time 0.7460
Coflows using b: Sb = [3]
Coflow 3 can be scheduled as the last one on link 3
sigma = [3,2,4,1]
sigma* = [1]

RemoveLateCoflow: consider coflow 1: cct = 3.6909, deadline = 1.2272
Coflow 1 is definitely rejected

Run Moore-Hodgson on link 1 with coflows [1,2,3,4]
	accepted coflows: S_{1} = [3,2]
	rejected coflows: E_{1} = []

Run Moore-Hodgson on link 2 with coflows [1,2,3,4]
	accepted coflows: S_{2} = [1,2]
	rejected coflows: E_{2} = [4]

Run Moore-Hodgson on link 3 with coflows [1,2,3,4]
	accepted coflows: S_{3} = [3,4]
	rejected coflows: E_{3} = [1]

Run Moore-Hodgson on link 4 with coflows [1,2,3,4]
	accepted coflows: S_{4} = [2,4]
	rejected coflows: E_{4} = []

Preliminary results:
	E_final = union(all E_ell) = [1,4]
	S_final = S\E_final = [2,3]

Sort S_final in increasing order of deadline (EDD):
	Deadlines of coflows [3,2] are [1.4606,1.7758] => S_final = [2,4]

Sort E_final in increasing order of max_{all ell} vol_{k,ell} / (T_k + epsilon)
	c1: volume on link [1,2,3,4] are [0,1.1173,1.1173,0]
		Criteria for c1 = max(c_vols)/(c.deadline + 1e-6)
						= max(0,1.1173,1.1173,0)/(1.22717 + 1e-6)
						= 1.11729/(1.22717 + 1e-6)
						= 0.91046
	c4: volume on link [1,2,3,4] are [0,2.0755,0.92073,1.1547]
		Criteria for c4 = max(c_vols)/(c.deadline + 1e-6)
						= max(0,2.0755,0.92073,1.1547)/(3.18203 + 1e-6)
						= 2.07546/(3.18203 + 1e-6)
						= 0.65224

Finally:
	S_final = [3,2], E_final = [4,1], sigma = [3,2,4,1]
